# The-Advent-of-Renewable-Energy
This repository contains my research paper titled 'The Advent of Renewable Energy' presented in the MidWest SAS Users Group (MWSUG) 2019 conference in Chicago.

**Abstract**

Renewable energy accounted for 12.2 % of total primary energy consumption and 14.94 % of the domestically produced electricity in the United States in 2016. The development of renewable energy and energy efficiency marked "a new era of energy exploration" in the United States, according to former President Barack Obama. This descriptive research focuses on how the usage of renewable and non-renewable energy has changed over the past 27 years in the USA. First, this research identifies correlations between renewable and non-renewable energy usage patterns. Second, this research explores the impact of economic factors on energy usage. Having a clear picture of energy usage by the world nations can help make effective policies for renewable energy adoption by different world countries. The data set is provided by the UN and it is used in SAS Enterprise GuideTM. Statistical methods such as time series analysis, trend line studies are used to make the visualizations meaningful. At first, the usage patterns of non-renewable energy are shown for the last 27 years from 1990 to 2016. Next, the usage patterns of renewable energy are shown for the same time period. We can see the exponential increase in energy production for solar and wind and a decrease in the usage of charcoal and brown coal. The usage studies of all world nations are made to assess which countries have been influential in fueling the observed trend. We can see from the analysis that the USA is among the countries that have the most significant growth rates in renewable energy usage although its overall capacity is lower in certain cases.

**Data**

The Energy Statistics Database contains comprehensive energy statistics on the production, trade, conversion and final consumption of primary and secondary; conventional and non-conventional; and new and renewable sources of energy.
This dataset was kindly published by the United Nations Statistics Division on the UNData site. The original dataset is here (http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx).
